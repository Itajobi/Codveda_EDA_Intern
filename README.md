# Level 1 – Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform an exploratory analysis on a
given dataset to identify patterns, trends, and
summary statistics.

## Objective
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode,
standard deviation).
Visualize data distributions using histograms, boxplots,
and scatter plots.
Find correlations between numerical features.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Summary Statistics
Calculated key descriptive statistics for all numerical features:

| Feature | Mean | Median | Mode | Std Dev |
|---------|------|--------|------|--------|

 |Open     | 86.35 |  64.97  |  70.0  | 101 |
 |High     | 87.13 |  65.56  |  72.0  | 102 |
 |Low      | 85.55 | 64.35  |  77.0   | 100 | 
 |Close    | 86.37 |  64.98  |  34.5  | 101 | 
||Volume   |~4.25M | ~2.08M  | ~1.24M |~8.23M|

## Visualizations
To understand distributions and relationships, the following plots were created:

- Histogram (Closing Prices) → shows price clustering and skewness
- Boxplot (Prices) → reveals volatility and outliers
- Scatter Plot (Open vs Close) → shows price movement patterns

## Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was generated to understand relationships between numerical features.

Key findings:
- Open, High, Low, and Close prices are highly correlated (~0.999)
- Trading Volume has weak correlation with prices (~ -0.15)

## Key Insights
- Stock prices are highly volatile with extreme outliers.
- Median values better reflect typical trading levels.
- Price features move together consistently.
- Trading volume does not strongly influence price changes.

- `Task2_Level1_EDA_StockAnalysis.ipynb` – contains full code, outputs, and visualizations.
